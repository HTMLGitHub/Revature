            What is a scripting language?
            a snippet of code taht automates some functionatlity. It is not a complete application or program
            ..it's just a snippet of code.

            What is JavaScript?
            it is a scripting language. Traditional languages like C++ are compiled BEFORE they run into executable binary form. 
            The compiler is our best friend because it checks for errors before the process is complete.

            Scripting languages, by contrast are executed line by line by an INTERPERTER

            JS is a scpriting language programming language which allows more dynamic functionality to web pages.
            JS is interpreted by the Browser..Google Crome's interpreter is v8 engine
            FireFox is SpiderMonkey.
            
            Later JS got so popular, that someone ripped out the Chrome's v8 engine and wrapped it in a C++ shell; thus Node.js was born around 2009.

            Features of JS:
                Object oriented
                Supports functional programming
                Loosely typed
                    (a variable can hold ANY data type)
                Dynamic (easily control JS during runtime)
                    you can modify the structure of obects while the program is running MORE than in non-dynamic languages.
                originally JS was buillt for DOM manipulation.
                    The DOM is a virtual representation of the HTML page
                Generally JS is either interpreted by 1 of 2 things: brower or node.js
